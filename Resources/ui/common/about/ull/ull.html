  	<h2>Louisiana at Lafayette</h2>
    <p>The University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the largest member of the University of Louisiana System, 
    	is a public institution of higher education offering bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees. 
    	Within the Carnegie classification, UL Lafayette is designated as a Research University with high research activity. 
    	The University’s academic programs are administered by the B. I. Moody III College of Business Administration, the Ray 
    	P. Authement College of Sciences, the Colleges of the Arts, Education, Engineering, General Studies, Liberal Arts, 
    	Nursing & Allied Health Professions, and the Graduate School. 
    	<br /><br />
    	The University is dedicated to achieving excellence in 
    	undergraduate and graduate education, in research, and in public service. For undergraduate education, this commitment 
    	implies a fundamental subscription to general education, rooted in the primacy of the traditional liberal arts and 
    	sciences as the core around which all curricula are developed. The graduate programs seek to develop scholars who will 
    	variously advance knowledge, cultivate aesthetic sensibility, and improve the material conditions of humankind. 
    	<br /><br />
    	The University reaffirms its historic commitment to diversity and integration. Thus, through instruction, research, 
    	and service, the University promotes regional economic and cultural development, explores solutions to national and 
    	world issues, and advances its reputation among its peers.
