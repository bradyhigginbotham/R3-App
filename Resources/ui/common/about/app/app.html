  	<h2>About this Application</h2>
    <p>The 2012 R3 mobile application lets you view conference schedules,
      competitions, certifications, maps, and presenter bios from the palm of your hand, as well
      as live updates from the official R3 Conference Twitter feed.  The 2012 R3
      mobile application for iPhone and Android devices was developed by Louisiana
      at Lafayette's own AITP students.
